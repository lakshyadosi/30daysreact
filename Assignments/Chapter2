2. ^ - caret and ~ - tilda ?

Ans: Real-world example:

You're using a package version 1.2.3
If you use ^1.2.3:

You might get version 1.3.0 (new features)
But you won't get 2.0.0 (big changes)


If you use ~1.2.3:

You might get version 1.2.4 (just bug fixes)
But you won't get 1.3.0 (new features)

Caret (^): Allows updates to any version that does not change the first non-zero number. For example, ^1.2.3 allows updates to versions 1.x.x but not 2.x.x.

Tilde (~): Allows updates to any version that does not change the middle number. For example, ~1.2.3 allows updates to versions 1.2.x but not 1.3.x.


The main idea:

^ : "Give me new features, but don't break my app"
~ : "Just give me bug fixes, nothing more"
