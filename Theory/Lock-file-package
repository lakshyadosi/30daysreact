Here's a simple example to illustrate a problem that can occur when you don't use package-lock.json:
Scenario: You're building a web app using Express.js

You start your project and install Express:
Copynpm install express
Your package.json shows: "express": "^4.17.1"
You develop your app and it works great on your machine.
A month later, your teammate clones the project and runs:
Copynpm install

Express releases a new minor version (e.g., 4.18.0) with some changes.
Your teammate's install gets this newer version due to the "^" in package.json.
Suddenly, a feature in your app doesn't work on your teammate's machine due to a small breaking change in the new Express version.
You both spend hours debugging, only to realize it's due to different Express versions.

If you had a package-lock.json:

It would have locked the exact version of Express.
Your teammate would get the exact same version you used.
The app would work identically on both machines.
You'd avoid wasting time on version-related bugs.

This example shows how package-lock.json prevents inconsistencies and saves development time, especially in team environments.
